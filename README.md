# GIT xD

Don't you think our commit messages are a bit too serious? Since I started xD
using `xD` with my commit messages my life in the company became ~152% better xD

Just look at these great examples how a simple `xD` at the end can make
communication inside your team much more humane xD

- closes #123 moved back button 6 pixels left xD
- closes #172 changed header color xD
- closes #422 fixed a possible memory leak when sharing handle between threads xD

Start adding `xD` to all your commit messages! xD

## Installing xD

Just copy `hooks/commit-msg` from this repo to your local `.git/hooks/` and
enjoy xD

## TODO xD

Please contribute xD

- JIRA plugin to add `xD` to every ticket title and every comment xD
- Slack plugin to add `xD` to every message xD
